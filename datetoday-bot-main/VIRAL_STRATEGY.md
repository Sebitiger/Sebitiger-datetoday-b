## 🚀 Profile Optimization

### Bio (160 characters max)
**Current:** Generic historian description

**Recommended:**
```
Uncovering the stories behind the stories 📚
Challenging what you think you know about history
Daily threads • Surprising facts • Hidden connections
```

**Or more provocative:**
```
The historian who makes you question everything 📚
Daily: Stories you didn't learn in school
Threads • Debunks • Surprising connections
```

### Pinned Tweet Strategy
**Goal:** Show your best content immediately

**Options:**
1. **Viral Thread** - Your most engaging thread (5-7 tweets)
2. **Controversial Take** - "Everyone thinks X, but actually Y..."
3. **Engagement Hook** - Question that got most replies
4. **Value Proposition** - "I post [unique angle] every day at [time]"

**Example Pinned Tweet:**
```
🧵 THREAD: 5 historical "facts" everyone believes that are actually wrong:

1/ Everyone thinks Napoleon was short. Actually, he was 5'7" - average height for his time. The "short" myth came from British propaganda.

2/ The "Dark Ages" weren't actually dark. This period saw incredible innovation in agriculture, architecture, and science.
