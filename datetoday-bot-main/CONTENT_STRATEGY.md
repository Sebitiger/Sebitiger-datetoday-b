# 🎯 Modern X Content Strategy

## What Makes Content Go Viral on X (2024-2025)

### Key Insights from Research

1. **Visual Content = 150% More Engagement**
   - Images/videos get significantly more retweets
   - Visual-first approach is critical
   - Every post should have compelling media

2. **Hook-Driven Content**
   - First 3 words determine if people keep reading
   - Surprising facts, questions, or bold statements work best
   - "Did you know...", "This is wild:", "Wait until you hear..."

3. **Engagement Triggers**
   - Questions that spark discussion
   - Controversial (but respectful) takes
   - Relatable connections to today
   - "Hot takes" on historical events

4. **Thread Structure**
   - Tweet 1: Hook that makes you want to read more
   - Tweet 2: Set up the story/context
   - Tweets 3-5: Build suspense, reveal details
   - Final tweet: Thought-provoking conclusion or question

5. **Optimal Posting**
   - Tues-Thurs, 9am-3pm (peak engagement)
   - Quality over quantity (3-5 posts/day)
   - Strategic timing for maximum reach

6. **Hashtags**
   - 1-2 hashtags = 21% higher engagement
   - More than 2 = diminishing returns
   - Use strategically, not every post

7. **No Links (X Algorithm Preference)**
   - X discourages external links
   - Long-form content performs better
   - Keep everything on-platform
